Lab 3, Part 1
Everyone remembers the mad lib game that we've all played at one point. Well in this Lab we had the opportunity to code our own variant of the game but that could be used for taking an order for a sandwhich. It was fantastic to see this cross between coding and a game from my childhood!

Lab 3, Part 2
In this part of lab 3 we coded a program that would do unit conversions among common kitchen units. This lab was one of my favorites as this was the first time we used a variable in the definition of another. This lab was a key component in understanding just how efficient code can be written.

Lab 9, Part 1
This lab was one of my favorites as we used the averaging algorithm. The algorithm was used to average olympic scores. Although the averaging algorithm was given to us to use, it was still interesting to somewhat understand how the algorithm was implemented in the code. It also taught just how important precision is when dealing with code as the smallest mistake could have cautastrophic failure.
